Beneath the sky of fading gold,
A quiet story waits, untold,
The breeze will carry dreams away,
To lands where night outshines the day.
The ocean hums its lullaby,
While silver clouds go drifting by,
Each wave a heartbeat, soft and true,
Whispering secrets meant for you.
And in this place where time stands still,
The soul drinks deep, the heart will fill,
With wonder found in eveningâ€™s hue,
A world reborn, both old and new.
